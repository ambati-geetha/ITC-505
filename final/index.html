    <h2>Addendum</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The *Lights Out Game* was developed as an interactive and visually engaging web-based game where players attempt to turn off all the lights on a grid. The project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on responsive design and dynamic interactions.</li>
        <li>During the design process:
            <ul>
                <li>I opted for a simple and clean layout with a soft purple background to create a visually calming environment.</li>
                <li>CSS grid was chosen to construct the game board due to its ease of implementation and flexibility.</li>
                <li>The interactive elements, such as the grid cells and reset button, were styled with hover effects and transitions to enhance user engagement.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Challenges faced:
            <ul>
                <li>Implementing the logic to correctly toggle the lights when a grid cell is clicked required careful management of adjacent elements' states.</li>
                <li>This challenge was overcome by breaking the problem into smaller tasks, such as mapping grid positions and debugging interactions incrementally.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Insights gained:
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding the importance of modular JavaScript code and the value of thorough planning before implementation.</li>
                <li>The experience reinforced the significance of user-centered design, ensuring that interactive elements are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
